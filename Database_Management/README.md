This is a knockoff Youtube website called MeTube. The actual wesbite cannot
be run unless on Clemson's VPN however all of the funtionality is in the 
technical Report.

This project was created for a Database Management course. 

While I worked with a team this project was done solo. One of the team members
dropped the class and the other did not contribute.

This was my first experience with HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and JS. It's also my
first time learning about database security. I learned more about secuirty later
in my college career.
