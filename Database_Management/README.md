# Description 

This is a knockoff Youtube website called MeTube. It tries to mimc the functionality of viewing images 
and videos, searching for keywords or categories, liking videos, commenting, owning an account, talking
to friends you have of other accounts, having, personal video lists, downloading and uploading content, and
others. 


# Setup

The website can be run by loading the contents in
`Metube_Files/database.sql` into a MySQL database. 

While in the Metube_Files folder, start a php server with the following command:
```
php -S 127.0.0.1:8000
```
From there go to [127.0.0.1:8000](127.0.0.1:8000) which will take you to the home page.


# Background 

This project was created for a Database Management course. In this course we learned how to create,
effectively design, manage, and use MySQL databases. 

While I worked with a team this project was done solo. One of the team members
dropped the class and the other did not contribute.

This was my first experience with HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and JS. It's also my
first time learning about database security. I learned more about secuirty later
in my college career.
