This contains the reaserch paper that my partner and I wrote as well as the
final exam for the course. These are included to show the level of problem solving
that went into the course. 

We researched the different levels of image compression and whether 2  different
Deep Learning models could  be trained on different levels of image compression. 

The files folder contains the homeworks and MATLAB files
used in the homeworks. The PDFs in the folders are only file of note to read.
