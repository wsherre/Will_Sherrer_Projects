# Malware Reverse Engineering
These are assignment that I have done in regards to malware reverse engingeering. 

In this class we learned about viruses and how they can install themselves onto Windows machines as well as persistance mechanisms different viruses used. 

The viruses were decompiled into Assembly where we then had to find key components of the virus using static and dynamic analysis. All viruses were run/decompiled on a Windows XP virtual Machine.
