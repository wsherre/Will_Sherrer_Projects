This folders contains a few assignments that I did during a network security class I took in Grad School.
In this class we learned about the different layers of a network and how to attack and defend each layer. 

For our final project we had to replicate and add on to an acceptable paper published to a Tier 1 security conference. 

We chose Firecracker which is a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) for AWS used to help initiate and run multiple Lambda instances and other 
smaller tasks. We added on to the paper by testing secuirty vulnerabilities that we found in Firecracker and were able to 
exploit.
