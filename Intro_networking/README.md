This project was designed to test my abilities in creating a network of servers and have them communicate with each other properly.
This tests that the servers were able to handle data and the application and network layer and are forwarded to the correct servers on the network.


I had to write the code for a server and client to initialize a socket, bind to the socket, and exchange information through sockets. 
I wrote the majoirty of the files CRCClient, CRCServer and MessageParser. This was also my first experience with python. 

Run CRCTestManager to see the tests performed on the servers.
