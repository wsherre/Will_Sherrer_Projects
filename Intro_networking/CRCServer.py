    # Parameters: 
    #   <servername>: the name of the new server
    #   <hopcount>: the number of hops required to reach this server
    #   [<info>]: human-readable name for the server
    # Examples: 
    #   SERVER rivendale.irc.edu 1 :The House of Elrond                     # This is an initial registration command coming from a new server
    #                                                                       # that should be connected to this server in the spanning tree
    #   :gondolin.irc.com SERVER rivendale.irc.edu 4 :The House of Elrond   # This is a notification from a known server about a new server
    #                                                                       # that has connected elsewhere into the spanning tree
    # Notes: 
    # This function handles the initial registrion process for new servers. The user must provide a unique servername
    # on registration. Upon receipt of a valid registration method, this function should create a new ServerData object containing 
    # this server's details. This should be stored in the servers_lookuptable, using the server's name as the key associated
    # with this new value. The server should then notify all other servers about this new server. 
    # 
    # Finally, the server should send the new server all known servers and users. This can be accomplished by sending 
    # SERVER and USER messages, and RPL_TOPIC/RPL_NOTOPIC and RPL_NAMEPLY messages, that inform the new server about every other
    # known server, user, and channel. Sending SERVER and USER messages will inform the new server about all servers and users 
    # using the normal registration code, and thus requires no additional development. You will need to complete the appropriate
    # RPL handlers for RPL_TOPIC, RPL_NOTOPIC, and RPL_NAMEPLY to enable the new server to register existing channel information.
    # These RPL handlers will only be used for this functionality.
    #
    # Additionally, the server the new server registers directly with also needs to replace the ConnectionData associated with this socket
    # that was created in accept_new_connection(). It should replace ConnectionData with the new ServerData object.
    # The ConnectionData object can be replaced using the selector.modify command (see python docs for more detail). This allows us
    # to determine that the connection received over that socket is from a server, and to determine which server, for all future
    # messages received from that socket
